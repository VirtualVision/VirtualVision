{"name":"Virtual Vision","tagline":"UTA Senior Design Project","body":"##Project Objective\r\nThe goal of our project was to add an eye tracking module to the Oculus Rift. To meet this goal we needed to...\r\n*Attach and use a camera inside a VR headset.\r\n*Do image processing and apply eye tracking software to determine the gaze of the eye.\r\n*Create an example application of the data.\r\n*Establish communication between all components.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe mounted a camera inside the  Oculus Rift and used a Raspberry Pi 2 to track the eye location and communicate with a PC using an Ethernet connection. We created a game in Unity to simulate the calibration process and show how to use the eye tracking data within an application. \r\n\r\n##Hardware\r\nWe fabricated custom Oculus Rift lens risers with a slot to insert the camera between the Oculus lens and the screen. The camera used was a Raspberry Pi Spy Camera with an added IR filter to get a better picture of the eye. We also mounted IR LED's on the Oculus Rift to get proper lighting.

The PC application uses this data when running a calibration routine and for determining the users gaze. The Unity game has in game targets for the user to look at during the calibration routine, and creates a graphical representation where the user is looking. Example pictures.\r\n\r\n## Creating pages manually\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
